 Using Yuno SDK Types

This package provides TypeScript types for integrating the Yuno SDK into your application. You can use the types in two ways: **importing them explicitly** or **using them globally**.

## 1. Including Types in `tsconfig.json`

To make the types available globally across your project, include them in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types/dist/global"]
  }
}
```

## 2. How to Use Types in Your Code

### a) **Importing Specific Types**

If you prefer to import specific types explicitly, you can do so like this:

```typescript
import { YunoInstance } from '@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types'

const yunoInstance: YunoInstance = Yuno.initialize('publicApiKey')
```

## 3. What Does the `tsconfig.json` Configuration Do?

By including `"types": ["@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types/dist/global"]` in your `tsconfig.json`, **you ensure that global types** (like `Yuno`) are available across your project without the need to import them explicitly.

## ðŸš€ Summary

- To use **explicit types**, import the specific types you need from `@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types`.
- To use **`Yuno` globally**, include the configuration in `tsconfig.json` to make `Yuno` available throughout your project without importing it.

With this setup, your Yuno SDK integration will be smooth, and TypeScript's type checking and autocompletion will help you ensure correctness in your code.
